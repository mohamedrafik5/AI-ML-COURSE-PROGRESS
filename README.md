# AI-ML-COURSE-PROGRESS
This repository contains my hands-on coding practice and projects from the AI/ML course at AISECT. It includes implementations of core machine learning algorithms using Python and popular libraries like NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn.The goal is to reinforce theoretical concepts through practical coding and real-world datasets.
